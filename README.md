
This project is a simple Java-based system that helps users track their daily lifestyle inputs (sleep, mood, productivity, caffeine, etc.) and understand their energy patterns. The program stores entries in a CSV file, analyses weekly trends, shows ASCII graphs, predicts next-day energy and mood, and gives useful insights like crash warnings and recommended deep-work time.

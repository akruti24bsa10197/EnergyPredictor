# **Project Statement**

## **1. Problem Statement**
People often experience fluctuations in their daily energy levels but rarely understand the reasons behind them. Factors like sleep, mood, productivity, caffeine intake, and daily routines affect how energetic or tired a person feels. Without tracking these inputs, it becomes difficult to observe patterns, predict low-energy days, or identify habits that need improvement.  
This project aims to provide a simple system that records these daily inputs and converts them into meaningful insights that help users understand their own energy patterns better.

## **2. Scope of the Project**
- The system will collect basic lifestyle inputs from the user once per day.
- Data will be stored in a CSV file for long-term tracking and analysis.
- The application will calculate an energy score and provide insights based on the collected data.
- Weekly summaries, predictions, and basic analytics will be displayed in a console interface.
- The project covers:
  - Data recording  
  - File handling  
  - Analysis & insights  
  - Simple visualizations (ASCII graphs)  
  - Energy and mood prediction  
- The project **does not** aim to provide medical accuracy or psychological evaluations.
